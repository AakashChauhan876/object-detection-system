#  Object Detection System

An enhanced real-time object detection system using YOLOv8 with GPU optimization. This project provides a robust implementation for video streams with an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Process video streams with optimized performance
- **GPU Acceleration**: Automatic CUDA detection and optimization
- **Interactive UI**: Keyboard shortcuts for adjusting settings on-the-fly
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time FPS, inference time, and detection counts
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Track detection hotspots over time
- **Screenshot Capability**: Capture and save detection results
- **Recording**: Save processed video output with detection annotations
- **Half-Precision Support**: FP16 inference for improved performance on compatible GPUs

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with CUDA support (recommended)
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
